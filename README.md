The aim of this project was to retrieve the initial workbook from Nilearn, available here: https://nilearn.github.io/dev/auto_examples/00_tutorials/plot_single_subject_single_run.html

We then modified and played with parameters to see how they influence the results obtained. Using our knowledge, we also explained what we were seeing from a neurological perspective.

The main thing to understand is that, in the workbook, we modify initial conditions. Initially, we register brain activity of a subject during periods (of the same length) of auditory stimulation versus periods of rest. In our case, we modify the periodic signal in the first part of the notebook.

I tried to explain step-by-step what we are doing in the code and explain the results. Enjoy!
